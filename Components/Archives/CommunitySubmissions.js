                    A low red mist clears outside the window of the train
                    carriage that I call home. Very much stationary train, I
                    should add, the wheels stuck fast into rock that has melted
                    and hardened from the heat of the volcano. I throw out the
                    wilted purple flower that I picked last week from the rich
                    volcanic soil on the road in to Yama, and then start getting
                    dressed for work. A jester must always be in costume, never
                    revealing themselves as too human, too real.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    And me, more than most. I start with the thick bandaging
                    that I wrap around my chest. One rotation, then another. My
                    skin crinkles dark above the folds. And then the trousers
                    cut low and loose around my crotch, the belt pulled in tight
                    at my waist. I pull on the jacket, tucking it in tightly,
                    setting the jagged edges of the collar neat against my
                    shoulders. The red baubles of my hat knock against my face,
                    bright balls that signal my profession. It was my twin
                    brother who gave this costume to me, the day he finally
                    found the courage to leave Yama, to go and join the coastal
                    warriors of Engan. I stayed behind, pulled between my love
                    for home and my cynical anger at the corruption of our
                    leaders. I took over my brotherâ€™s role, his work, his life.
                    I even took over his name. The warriors at the palace could
                    not tell the difference. My voice a little higher, my body a
                    little softer, but the differences are too small for those
                    in power to bother to notice.
                    <br />I set out on to the road, gripping my sword tighter
                    than usual today. The road to the palace feels dangerous,
                    uneasy, as though everyone is waiting for a sign. Perhaps it
                    is the moon that sat heavy and red all night, or maybe it is
                    the low rumbles of the mountain that has interrupted the
                    sleep of the city for the last few days. Children play in
                    the rusty dust of the road and women scream out the prices
                    of the feeble produce that they attempt to sell. I ignore
                    them all, even as the children run about my feet, begging me
                    for a joke.
                    <br />I reach the palace, warriors milling in the quad.
                    Energy fizzes with uncertainty, a new darkness that clogs
                    the corners of the corridors, hooded men glancing anxiously
                    at one another.
                    <br />
                    By the time I get to the hall, the councillors are ready to
                    meet. I stand at the edge of the room, waiting. If I am
                    lucky, they will forget I am even here. Nik the jester,
                    harmless, good for a few cynical jibes and jests. Little do
                    they know that I hear everything. I can sense their
                    decisions, their bribes, their thoughtless words that led to
                    lives lost, warriors sharpening their weapons. What would
                    they really think of me if they knew how dangerous I could
                    be?
