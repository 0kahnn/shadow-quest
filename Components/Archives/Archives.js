                    Some tales even spoke of a glorious utopia inside The

                  , which flourished with prosperity, safety, and serenity.
                  However, it was common knowledge that the region was
                  uninhabitable due to the radioactive gas that engulfed it.
                  Most archaeologists, anthropologists, and researchers

                  Those who sought to study The Wasteland traveled thousands of
                  miles, only to be met with choking clouds of poisonous
                  radioactive gas. It was thought to be impossible to survive
                  the region’s toxic fog, let alone whatever danger laid behind
                  it. Only the most resourceful adventurers could endure such
                  conditions. Upon arriving at its border, one was forced to
                  travel for weeks on end through treacherous terrain and
                  radioactive plains. If the fabled stories were true, these
                  individuals would eventually stumble upon the utopia within.
                  They just had to survive.

                  While the world’s nine Bloodlines engaged in trade and
                  conflict throughout the centuries, a tenth civilization
                  existed behind The Wasteland’s shroud of impenetrable gas.{" "}
