                  Tensions build as five dominant nations struggle for supremacy
                  in a world where the old and new collide.
                  <br /> <br />
                  Over 100 years, war has become a way of life for all, but each
                  person has adapted by their own means. Some have clung to the
                  old ways, honing their strength and skills to become fearsome
                  warriors. Others have sought ancient texts to muster unknown
                  powers whilst pushing their arcane knowledge to the limit.
                  Others look to the future and construct fantastical steam
                  machines capable of monstrous damage.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The Generals, Shamans, and Chief Technologists who have
                  dedicated their lives to destruction grow impatient to display
                  their recent expansion in military power, whilst the diplomats
                  struggle to maintain a semblance of control.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  However, in the late night tea-rooms and dens, dark
                  whisperings begin to swirl. The travelling merchants mumble
                  about an unease across the lands, the druids fret about
                  strange behaviours in their forests, and the soothsayers feel
                  a shroud approaching which blocks their vision past the
                  solstice. Shadows deepen, the skies darken, and the omen
                  approaches…

                      The vast plains of the Kiroh nation provide the perfect

                      population. However, as trading wealth accumulates in the
                      market towns, greed and avarice follow soon after. Over
                      time, the market towns have swollen to sprawling cities
                      where cunning and nous are as valuable as anything the
                      markets sell, and only the most decisive survive here.
                      Speed is of the essence as markets move fast, information
                      faster and the hand that strikes first, thrives. Are you

                    The people of Midsurin reside in grand forests with ancient trees that have moulded the landscape for millennia. Amongst the towering canopies were certain smaller, but uniquely gnarled, trees that continued to flower even in the harshest of seasons and seemed to instil a sense of calm with their rich musky scent. As curiosity grew and shamanic knowledge improved, the Midsurins discovered that these trees have learnt not to stretch for the sun, but to reach deep down where great seams of crystal run through the earth.
                    <br /><br />
                    Again the Midsurins interest was piqued and the whole nation entered a fervent drive to discover what these subterranean rivers of crystal bestowed upon their sacred trees. They tried digging and excavating, but none of their tools could crack the crystal. Ultimately only the trees’ roots were able to draw on the underground power, and through the trees sap, bark, and leaves, the Midsurins could begin to wield the strange powers that came from the earth.

                     A land of scored earth and fiery vents has resulted in the Yamans becoming the most resilient nation. Despite the unforgiving environment, great value is released in the lava flows as innumerable molten metals rise to the surface. This unending supply of valuable materials provided a lifeline for the Yamans because it gave bargaining power and opened up trade routes. The arid land could never support a significant population, but when metals were traded for food and produce with a bountiful country like Kiroh, the population grew. As confidence, pride and wealth exploded, the leaders formed a strategic alliance with Engan who had an insatiable thirst for rare metals with undecipherable designs. This meant that the fragile dependence they had on Kiroh would not be so easily shattered.

                    Engan was once ruled by a fearsome queen who conquered enough lands to rival Kiroh for might. However, she quickly lost interest in marching to far off lands with her army. Instead she busied herself with books, meeting eccentric people with singed hair and dirty aprons, and building orphanages. 
                    <br /><br />
                    When her son assumed the throne many years later, his impatience caused him to lead a hasty campaign aiming to best his mother’s successes. Unfortunately his armies were demolished and the Engan borders were pushed all the way back to the sealine. With no king, no army, the Engan people retreated to the seas, and sought refuge in their books and research. Their free thinking, highly trained minds developed fantastical inventions, some capable of incredible speed, others of terrifying destructive powers. Their skill in technology and at the sea is unparalleled and has solidified them as a force to be reckoned with once more.

                    A low red mist clears outside the window of the train
                    carriage that I call home. Very much stationary train, I
                    should add, the wheels stuck fast into rock that has melted
                    and hardened from the heat of the volcano. I throw out the
                    wilted purple flower that I picked last week from the rich
                    volcanic soil on the road into Yama, and then start getting
                    dressed for work. A jester must always be in costume, never
                    revealing themselves as too human, too real.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    And me, more than most. I start with the thick bandaging
                    that I wrap around my chest. One rotation, then another. My
                    skin crinkles dark above the folds. And then the trousers
                    cut low and loose around my crotch, the belt pulled in tight
                    at my waist. I pull on the jacket, tucking it in tightly,
                    setting the jagged edges of the collar neat against my
                    shoulders. The red baubles of my hat knock against my face,
                    bright balls that signal my profession. It was my twin
                    brother who gave this costume to me, the day he finally
                    found the courage to leave Yama, to go and join the coastal
                    warriors of Engan. I stayed behind, pulled between my love
                    for home and my cynical anger at the corruption of our
                    leaders. I took over my brother’s role, his work, his life.
                    I even took over his name. The warriors at the palace could
                    not tell the difference. My voice a little higher, my body a
                    little softer, but the differences are too small for those
                    in power to bother to notice.
                    <br />I set out on to the road, gripping my sword tighter
                    than usual today. The road to the palace feels dangerous,
                    uneasy, as though everyone is waiting for a sign. Perhaps it
                    is the moon that sat heavy and red all night, or maybe it is
                    the low rumbles of the mountain that has interrupted the
                    sleep of the city for the last few days. Children play in
                    the rusty dust of the road and women scream out the prices
                    of the feeble produce that they attempt to sell. I ignore
                    them all, even as the children run about my feet, begging me
                    for a joke. I reach the palace, warriors milling in the
                    quad. Energy fizzes with uncertainty, a new darkness that
                    clogs the corners of the corridors, hooded men glancing
                    anxiously at one another.
                    <br />
                    By the time I get to the hall, the councillors are ready to
                    meet. I stand at the edge of the room, waiting. If I am
                    lucky, they will forget I am even here. Nik the jester,
                    harmless, good for a few cynical jibes and jests. Little do
                    they know that I hear everything. I can sense their
                    decisions, their bribes, their thoughtless words that led to
                    lives lost, warriors sharpening their weapons. What would
                    they really think of me if they knew how dangerous I could
                    be?

                    Many songs sing of this monster, many stories tell about
                    this hero. Haruto the glutton, monster, Chi no okui,
                    Kushinbo are a few of the names that have been used through
                    the ages. But I knew the man, the man that saved this
                    village. I can’t speak on the stories of him killing 300 men
                    with his sword or destroying Minka town. All I can tell you
                    is about Haruto Kaiba the man I knew.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I met him way back when he was journeying through the
                    country side. His small frame painted a wrong picture of his
                    abilities and his sword was even less impressive. It looked
                    old brittle and rusted. At first I laughed at the sight but
                    as time passed I came to fear the weapon. Haruto never
                    wanted to tell me where he got it from, even though I asked
                    him every time I saw him. The double sided blade with its
                    rusted look and the skull on the end of the hilt were
                    symbols that he came to be know by. I know many called him
                    Chi no okui (blood glutton), but only few knew that, that
                    was the name of his trusty sword. “I always wondered who
                    started calling Haruto that, he was one of the kindest men I
                    knew. He often helped villager is his passing by.
                    <br />
                    During the time of turmoil back in the days ‘Sakura wars’.
                    This very village were you stand today was saved by him.
                    Many soldiers from the Hanoko clan came to our village
                    demanding food men and women. Many tried to resist but was
                    met with pure evil. Many men that tried to make a stand were
                    cut down in form of their loved ones, even our elders were
                    killed. I tried to protect as many as I could but these
                    hands were not made to fight, “as my father told me”. I
                    gathered as much people I could and hid them in the woods.
                    The gods must have been with me that day. As I was captured
                    by a Hanoko scum, I heard more screams from a distance. It
                    was him he was walking through as if nothing was wrong. The
                    soldiers approached him with pure evil intent. Haruto swung
                    his blade with the speed of lightning. That is the first
                    time I saw the evil of that sword.
                    <br />
                    As the first slash connected with the attacking soldier.
                    That cursed sword seemed to change. The blood that was left
                    from its victim on its rusted blade. This is when I saw it,
                    the sword started changing. I swear I saw the blood being
                    absorbed. Two soldiers rushed Haruto from behind he moved
                    out the way, his speed that of a shadow. As he slashed them
                    bot with one confident swing. As the slashes continued the
                    rusted sword started transforming, the rust slowly started
                    dissolving the more the blade came in contact with the red
                    nectar that left the soldiers bodies. Haruto made sure to
                    finish of the soldiers he showed no mercy. It was as if the
                    sword demanded it. Some bodies sucked dried and discoloured
                    scared the others. The rusted blade was now gone. I swear,
                    the more that fell to the sword, the faster the blade and
                    its wielder moved. The eerily skull on the hilt had turned
                    red as if it filled with the blood from its victims. The
                    faster he moved the more Hanoko soldiers fell. A dark mist
                    started to form around Haruto. At every swing Chi no oku
                    claimed more blood from its victims. Or should I say drink?
                    I saw droplets make their way to the sword if they strayed
                    too far away. Haruto dragged the his blade over the blood
                    drenched floor and al is could see was the blood being
                    sucked up from the floor. A true glutton, I could not
                    believe my eyes. One of the remaining soldiers tried to run
                    away. But Haruto would not give him that, he launched his
                    trusted blade as an arrow at the fleeing soldier. The last I
                    heard was an eerily scream as the sword pierced the soldiers
                    skull. Haruto was the last man standing that day, as an evil
                    smile took over his face. I would not have recognized him if
                    it wasn’t for his clothing.
                    <br />
                    That was the first time I was afraid of my friend. There
                    were at least 100 Hanoko soldiers in our village that day,
                    none stood at the end. He was made a hero of our village
                    that day.
                    <br />
                    “After telling this story I can understand why some call him
                    a monster. But to me he was a friend and a hero.”
