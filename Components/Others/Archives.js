                  Tensions build as five dominant nations struggle for supremacy
                  in a world where the old and new collide.
                  <br /> <br />
                  Over 100 years, war has become a way of life for all, but each
                  person has adapted by their own means. Some have clung to the
                  old ways, honing their strength and skills to become fearsome
                  warriors. Others have sought ancient texts to muster unknown
                  powers whilst pushing their arcane knowledge to the limit.
                  Others look to the future and construct fantastical steam
                  machines capable of monstrous damage.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The Generals, Shamans, and Chief Technologists who have
                  dedicated their lives to destruction grow impatient to display
                  their recent expansion in military power, whilst the diplomats
                  struggle to maintain a semblance of control.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  However, in the late night tea-rooms and dens, dark
                  whisperings begin to swirl. The travelling merchants mumble
                  about an unease across the lands, the druids fret about
                  strange behaviours in their forests, and the soothsayers feel
                  a shroud approaching which blocks their vision past the
                  solstice. Shadows deepen, the skies darken, and the omen
                  approaches…

                      The vast plains of the Kiroh nation provide the perfect
                      landscape for abundant harvests to support the burgeoning
                      population. However, as trading wealth accumulates in the
                      market towns, greed and avarice follow soon after. Over
                      time, the market towns have swollen to sprawling cities
                      where cunning and nous are as valuable as anything the
                      markets sell, and only the most decisive survive here.
                      Speed is of the essence as markets move fast, information
                      faster and the hand that strikes first, thrives. Are you
                      sharp enough to fight amongst the fastest?

                    The people of Midsurin reside in grand forests with ancient trees that have moulded the landscape for millennia. Amongst the towering canopies were certain smaller, but uniquely gnarled, trees that continued to flower even in the harshest of seasons and seemed to instil a sense of calm with their rich musky scent. As curiosity grew and shamanic knowledge improved, the Midsurins discovered that these trees have learnt not to stretch for the sun, but to reach deep down where great seams of crystal run through the earth.
                    <br /><br />
                    Again the Midsurins interest was piqued and the whole nation entered a fervent drive to discover what these subterranean rivers of crystal bestowed upon their sacred trees. They tried digging and excavating, but none of their tools could crack the crystal. Ultimately only the trees’ roots were able to draw on the underground power, and through the trees sap, bark, and leaves, the Midsurins could begin to wield the strange powers that came from the earth.

                     A land of scored earth and fiery vents has resulted in the Yamans becoming the most resilient nation. Despite the unforgiving environment, great value is released in the lava flows as innumerable molten metals rise to the surface. This unending supply of valuable materials provided a lifeline for the Yamans because it gave bargaining power and opened up trade routes. The arid land could never support a significant population, but when metals were traded for food and produce with a bountiful country like Kiroh, the population grew. As confidence, pride and wealth exploded, the leaders formed a strategic alliance with Engan who had an insatiable thirst for rare metals with undecipherable designs. This meant that the fragile dependence they had on Kiroh would not be so easily shattered.

                    Engan was once ruled by a fearsome queen who conquered enough lands to rival Kiroh for might. However, she quickly lost interest in marching to far off lands with her army. Instead she busied herself with books, meeting eccentric people with singed hair and dirty aprons, and building orphanages. 
                    <br /><br />
                    When her son assumed the throne many years later, his impatience caused him to lead a hasty campaign aiming to best his mother’s successes. Unfortunately his armies were demolished and the Engan borders were pushed all the way back to the sealine. With no king, no army, the Engan people retreated to the seas, and sought refuge in their books and research. Their free thinking, highly trained minds developed fantastical inventions, some capable of incredible speed, others of terrifying destructive powers. Their skill in technology and at the sea is unparalleled and has solidified them as a force to be reckoned with once more.
