                    In ancient lands, elite Warriors train and battle for $HONR.
                    They can choose to hone their skills in the Training Grounds
                    where they will safely earn $HONR each day for their hard
                    work. Or they can choose to charge into the Battlefield
                    where their skills will be truly put to the test and they
                    can earn significant $HONR every hour. With more $HONR, you
                    can recruit more Warriors to fight for you. But, a
                    mysterious dark army with strange powers has come to
                    challenge your $HONR…
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Each hour you fight in the Battlefield, you will earn hefty
                    $HONR rewards, however if you wish to retreat from the
                    Battlefield you have a choice: flee with your tail between
                    your legs and drop 15% of your earned $HONR, OR choose to
                    battle the Samsar one final time. If you win, you will
                    double your $HONR spoils of war and go down in history,
                    however if you lose, the Samsar will take all of your $HONR.
                    <br />
                    Finally the danger is not over: when you recruit a new
                    Warrior, there is a chance they will be ruthlessly stolen by
                    the Samsar!
