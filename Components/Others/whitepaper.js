                    In ancient lands, elite Warriors train and battle for $HONR.
                    They can choose to hone their skills in the Training Grounds
                    where they will safely earn $HONR each day for their hard
                    work. Or they can choose to charge into the Battlefield
                    where their skills will be truly put to the test and they
                    can earn significant $HONR every hour. With more $HONR, you
                    can recruit more Warriors to fight for you. But, a
                    mysterious dark army with strange powers has come to
                    challenge your $HONR…
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Each hour you fight in the Battlefield, you will earn hefty
                    $HONR rewards, however if you wish to retreat from the
                    Battlefield you have a choice: flee with your tail between
                    your legs and drop 15% of your earned $HONR, OR choose to
                    battle the Samsar one final time. If you win, you will
                    double your $HONR spoils of war and go down in history,
                    however if you lose, the Samsar will take all of your $HONR.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Finally the danger is not over: when you recruit a new
                    Warrior, there is a chance they will be ruthlessly stolen by
                    the Samsar!

                    NFT risk has only started being explored, and we are
                    building on recent advances to provide more opportunities
                    for holders. ShadowQuest will open the gateway and then push
                    the boundaries for more interactive decision making
                    strategies that incorporate market dynamics, game theory,
                    and tokenomics.

                    We’re also combining the best aspects of the NFT world to
                    provide the greatest value and experience for all holders.
                    For example, we are:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Generating high quality hand-drawn art for each Warrior
                        backed by incredible community-written lore,
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Incorporating NFT risk metrics for an exciting gaming

                      <li>
                        Implementing future interlocking benefits to the new

                      <li>
                        Growing a community that supports each other and
                        celebrates new art, writing, and technological advances

                    </ul>
                    And finally, our devs are experienced NFT coders and will be
                    using upgradeable contracts that will enable us to:

                    </ul>
                    It will be possible to interact directly with the
                    ShadowQuest contracts on Etherscan after minting. But we
                    will create a custom webpage with an efficient UI so it will
                    be easy for everyone to strategize and make their battle

                    In ShadowQuest you make the decisions on how much risk you
                    are willing to take. Play it safe and earn steady rewards in
                    the Training Ground? Or go for glory and fight for $HONR in
                    the brutal Battlefield! Perhaps you’re willing to risk even
                    more and challenge the Samsar in an epic final battle where
                    losing leaves you without $HONR, but also gives you a chance
                    to earn even more $HONR than ever before!
